Still to do :
-------------

Core
- allow binding to a specific interface

General
- internationalize messages
- wrap spam verdicts in XML
- givemail and csv2givemail have a lot in common, yet don't share much
- move slave code out of givemail to givemail-slave
- add substitution variables for day, month and year, with arithmetic operations support
- move attachment pattern matching out of csv2givemail, this would be useful to givemail too; right now the pattern is hardcoded to "*blah-*".
- endofcampaign could simply be an URL to GET or POST to since givemail has a dependency on curl/neon
- reload on SIGHUP
- allow specifying the port number when calling givemail in -x mode
- abort if any XML input file isn't valid

Unicode support
- all user interfaces to only take UTF-8 in

XML over HTTP API
- allow uploading files that can later be used as email attachments
- check the type and range of all fields

DB
- allow using one or another DB backend
- make sure all fields used to build SQL statements are escaped and/or checked
